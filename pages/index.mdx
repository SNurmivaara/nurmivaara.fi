# Sami Nurmivaara

Hey there! I'm a MSc in Computer Science and a senior DevOps / Cloud / Fullstack developer from Finland offering my services through my own company, Nurmivaara Consulting Oy.

Previously both consulting and product development, with a side of academic research under my belt.

I'm a cloud native AWS Fullstack developer, specialty in event based architectures, data integrations and backends with: 
- JS/TS (Node, Next, Express)
- Cloud: AWS, GCP, Azure but also Openshift (Kubernetes)
- REST API's and data integrations (APIGateway, GraphQL etc.)
- Highly scalable event based serverless architectures (Lambda, DynamoDB etc.)
- DevOps (Github Actions, Terraform, Gitlab CI, ArgoCD, Vercel etc.)
- Data engineering (PostgreSQL and DynamoDB with a bit of experience in data warehousing, data lakes and ETL). 

Previous experience also in Ruby, Java and PHP, other *SQL databases.

Agile DevOps enthusiast with AWS Architect Associate certificate (update: expired as of Q4 of 2022, will re-certify at some point) and plenty of experience running projects with frameworks such as Scrum.

My soft skills include leadership and mentoring capability. I enjoy holding workshops, arranging events and public speaking. 

Let's connect and explore the possibilities!
