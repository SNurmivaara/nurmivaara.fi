# Sami Nurmivaara

Hey there! I'm a Software specialist from Finland with 6+ years of tech industry experience and soon-to-be MSc in Computer Science.

I'm looking for my next role or contracting/freelancing position.

Especially interested in environmental and societal issues or national security.

Previously both consulting and in-house positions, with a side of academic research under my belt.

I'm a cloud native AWS Fullstack developer, specialty in data integrations and backends with: 
- JS/TS (Node, Next, Express)
- Amazon Web Services (AWS), could be persuaded into GCP
- REST API's and data integrations (APIGateway, GraphQL etc.)
- Highly scalable event based serverless architectures (Lambda, DynamoDB etc.)
- DevOps (Github Actions, Codebuild, Cloudformation, Vercel etc.)
- Data engineering (PostgreSQL and DynamoDB with a bit of experience in data warehousing, data lakes and ETL). 

Previous experience also in Ruby, Java and PHP, other *SQL databases.

Agile DevOps enthusiast with AWS Architect Associate certificate (update: expired as of Q4 of 2022, will re-certify at some point) and plenty of experience with Agile methodologies like Scrum.

My soft skills include leadership and mentoring capability. I enjoy holding workshops, arranging events and public speaking. 

I love hackathons and have also previously been a co-founder, and as such an innovator and entrepreneurial at heart.

With a combination of technical and interpersonal skills, I am confident that I would be a valuable addition to any organization. Let's connect and explore the possibilities!
