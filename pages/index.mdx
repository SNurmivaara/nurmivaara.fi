Previously both consulting and in-house positions, with a side of academic research under my belt.

I'm a cloud native AWS Fullstack developer, specialty in architectures, data integrations and backends with: 
- JS/TS (Node, Next, Express)

- Highly scalable event based serverless architectures (Lambda, DynamoDB etc.)
- DevOps (Github Actions, Codebuild, Cloudformation, Vercel etc.)

Previous experience also in Ruby, Java and PHP, other *SQL databases.

Agile DevOps enthusiast with AWS Architect Associate certificate (update: expired as of Q4 of 2022, will re-certify at some point) and plenty of experience with Agile methodologies like Scrum.
