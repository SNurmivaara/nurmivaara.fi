# Sami Nurmivaara

Hey there! I'm a fullstack cloud native developer from Finland with 6+ years of tech industry experience and I'm looking for my next role or contracting/freelancing position. 
Especially interested in environmental and societal issues or national security. Previously both consulting and in-house positions, with a side of academic research under my belt.

Cloud native AWS Fullstack developer, specialty in data integrations and backends with: 
- JS/TS (Node, Next, Express)
- Amazon Web Services (AWS), could be persuaded into GCP
- REST API's and data integrations (APIGateway, GraphQL etc.)
- Highly scalable event based serverless architectures (Lambda, DynamoDB etc.)
- Data engineering (PostgreSQL and DynamoDB with a bit of experience in data warehousing, data lakes and ETL). 

Previous experience also in Ruby, Java and PHP, other *SQL databases. Besides development and data engineering, an Agile DevOps enthusiast with AWS Architect Associate certificate (update: expired as of Q4 of 2022, will re-certify at some point) and plenty of experience with Agile methodologies like Scrum.

I have leadership experience from both professional and personal life with multiple years of being a chairman and board member in various non-profits, which all started with the biggest leadership school in Finland, being a NCO at the Finnish Defense Forces. I enjoy holding workshops, arranging events and public speaking. I love hackathons and have also previously been a co-founder, and as such an innovator and entrepreneurial at heart.

I am eager to join a team that values collaboration, innovation and a commitment to making a positive impact. With a combination of technical and interpersonal skills, I am confident that I would be a valuable addition to any organization. Let's connect and explore the possibilities!
